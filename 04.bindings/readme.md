# 04. Resource bindings

It's time to finally do something with our patient profile picture we have been retrieving. We will use an output blob storage binding to upload the generated image.

## Review

1. Setup Azurite container
2. Blob storage binding component
   - `components/blobstorage.yaml`
3. Test
   - `appointment.http`
3. Verify
   - Azure Storage Explorer
